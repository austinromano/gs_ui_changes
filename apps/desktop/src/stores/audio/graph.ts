/**
 * Audio routing — Ableton/FL Studio style bus architecture.
 *
 *   Track / drum source → trackGain ─┐
 *                                    ├──→ mixerBus → masterGain ──→ destination
 *   Track / drum source → trackGain ─┘                            ↘
 *                                                                   masterAnalyser  (parallel meter — does NOT chain on)
 *
 * Three reasons this matters:
 *   1. Single mixer bus is the natural place to hang sends, FX returns, and
 *      eventually a UI mixer with channel strips.
 *   2. Meters tap off masterGain in PARALLEL — they don't sit in the audio
 *      path. AnalyserNode is spec'd as transparent but every node in series
 *      adds a render-quantum of latency and a numerical pass; keeping the
 *      output chain as short as possible (gain → masterGain → destination)
 *      preserves the cleanest signal.
 *   3. getMaster() still returns the entry point everything connects to,
 *      so existing callers (audioStore.startAllSources, drumRackStore
 *      scheduler) keep working without a rename.
